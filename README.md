# edX-Bootcamp-Portfolio Starter


## Description

This project uses HTML and CSS to create an online portfolio for myself as a front-end developer, displaying completed work, general information, and contact details. The nav-bar, in the top-right corner can be used to navigate to the related section.

As this is an ongoing project, some of the links in the 'Work' section are currently placeholders with the 'Pre-work Study Guide' and 'Search Engine Optimisation' having working links.

Press CTRL + SHFT + I (Windows) or CMD + SHFT + I (Mac OS) to open the Chrome DevTools window and view accessibility improvements in HTML and CSS. Locate the 'Inspect' button in the top-left of the Chrome DevTools window, and hover over images on the webpage to view their alt-text. Hovering over different content on the webpage will also provide information on which semantic HTML element the content belongs to in the Chrome DevTool window.
